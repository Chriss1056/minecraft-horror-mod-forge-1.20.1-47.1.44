# minecraft-horror-mod-forge-1.20.1-47.1.44
This is a minecraft horror mod I'm creating for a friend of mine.

## Version: ```Pre-Alpha 0.0.0.35```

## Status: [![Build](https://github.com/Chriss1056/minecraft-horror-mod-forge-1.20.1-47.1.44/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chriss1056/minecraft-horror-mod-forge-1.20.1-47.1.44/actions/workflows/build.yml)

## Requirements:
  - He will be able to pick up blocks and throw them.
  - He will be able to communicate with the player via signs or pre-recorded voice messages.
  - He will be more agressive in the night than in the day.
  - He will start to chase the player based on a random behaviour pattern and sometimes even kill the player.
  - He will be able to build advanced structures or modify existing structures.
  - He will be able to shapeshift.

## Optional Features
  - He could have an advanced behaviour pattern with multiple stages based on player progression.
  - The game could be split into multiple chapters and in each chapter the behaviour pattern slightly changes.

## Important
  - He will have a weakness that is decided on a specific set of parameters at random each time a new world is generated and the player must discover this weakness to eventually contain or even terminate him.

## This is not the completed version of this Minecraft mod and won't work in its current state!
